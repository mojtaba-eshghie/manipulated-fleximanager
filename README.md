# flexiManage

This repository contains the flexiManage backend component from flexiWAN. flexiManage service is used for managing [flexiEdge devices](https://docs.flexiwan.com/overview/arch.html#flexiedge). It allows users to create users and accounts and manage the entire network inventory of the organizations in the account.

Our hosted service https://manage.flexiwan.com provides a free UI access to the flexiManage service where users can create an account and use up to 3 flexiEdge devices for free.

## What is included in this repository

The flexiManage backend component provides REST API for managing the flexiWAN network, configuring and connecting to the flexiWAN flexiEdge devices. 
The repository includes two git submodules which are used by the flexiWAN SaaS service and are not open. 

When pulling the flexiManage repository, 
these submodules would be seen as an empty directory:
* client - a git submodule for the flexiWAN SaaS UI. The UI provides the user side logic and design for managing the network. It uses REST to access flexiManage
* backend/billing - a git submodule for managing the flexiWAN SaaS billing

These submodules are not required for running the backend serivce and are used for the UI and Billing additions on top of flexiManage.
To experience the complete flexiWAN system, open a free account on our [hosted system](https://flexiwan.com/pricing).
